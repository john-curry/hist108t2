Abstract = {The article discusses the political aspects of the development of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Shuttle. Particular focus is given to conflicts, events, and discourses surrounding the militarization and marketization of NASA and the Shuttle. According to the author, NASA needed to serve both its own interests of exploration and scientific advancement and the interests of other U.S. government bodies and officials who sought the military and financial exploitation of space. It is suggested that conflicts over the program reached a period of fragile stabilization 1970s and 1980s which was broken by the Challenger disaster of 1986. Other topics include U.S. President Richard Nixon, the financial management of NASA, and the shuttle Enterprise.},

Abstract = {This work is supported and managed through the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center—SBIR Program. Studies on cells exposed to microgravity and hypergravity indicate that human cells need gravity to stimulate cell growth. As the gravitational force increases or decreases, the cell function responds in a linear fashion. This poses significant health risks for astronauts in long termspace flight. LED-technology developed for NASA plant growth experiments in space shows promise for delivering light deep into tissues of the body to promote wound healing and human tissue growth. This LED-technology is also biologically optimal for photodynamic therapy of cancer. © 2000 American Institute of Physics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {West, John B. Historical aspects of the early Soviet/Russian manned space program. J Appl Physiol 91: 1501-1511, 2001.— Human spaceflight was one of the great physiological and engineering triumphs of the 20th century. Although the history of the United States manned space program is well known, the Soviet program was shrouded in secrecy until recently. Konstantin Edvardovich Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935) was an extraordinary Russian visionary who made remarkable predictions about space travel in the late 19th century. Sergei Pavlovich Korolev (1907-1966) was the brilliant “Chief Designer” who was responsible for many of the Soviet firsts, including the first artificial satellite and the first human being in space. The dramatic flight of Sputnik 1 was followed within a month by the launch of the dog Laika, the first living creature in space. Remarkably, the engineering work for this payload was all done in less than 4 wk. Korolev's greatest triumph was the flight of Yuri Alekseyevich Gagari},

Abstract = {This paper presents a brief overview of air-breathing propulsion research conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) over the last 70 years. It includes a historical perspective of the center and its various stages of propulsion research in response to the country's different periods of crises and growth opportunities. The GRC's research and technology development covered a broad spectrum, from a short-term focus on improving the energy efficiency of aircraft engines to advancing the frontier technologies of high-speed aviation in the supersonic and hypersonic speed regimes. This paper highlights major research programs, showing their impact on industry and aircraft propulsion, and briefly discusses current research programs and future aeropropulsion technology trends in related areas.

It mentions the proposed explanation for mysterious microwave brightness of Venus as shown by Mariner 2 image. It suggests the need to figure out how planets work as the world enters the new geological era called anthropocene. It also looks forward to next-generation of Venus missions that will follow the trail blazed by Mariner 2.},
